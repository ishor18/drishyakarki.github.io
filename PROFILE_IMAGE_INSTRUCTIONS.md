# Profile Image Instructions

A placeholder profile image has been created at `profile.png`.

## To Replace with Your Actual Photo:

1. **Prepare your photo:**
   - Use a square image (1:1 ratio recommended)
   - Minimum size: 500x500 pixels
   - Recommended: 1000x1000 pixels for best quality
   - Format: JPG or PNG

2. **Replace the file:**
   - Simply replace `profile.png` with your actual photo
   - Keep the filename as `profile.png`
   - Or update the `src` in `index.html` if using a different filename

3. **The image will automatically:**
   - Display as a circle
   - Have a gradient border (blue to purple)
   - Scale up slightly on hover
   - Look professional and polished

## Current Setup:
- ✅ Profile image section added to About Me
- ✅ Circular display with gradient border
- ✅ Hover animation effect
- ✅ Responsive layout
